**Objective:**

To assess the overall sentiment of product reviews using two sentiment analysis models: VADER and RoBERTa.

**Methods:**

_VADER:_ A lexicon-based model used for sentiment analysis, which is simpler and faster. It evaluates sentiment based on predefined word lists and rules.

_RoBERTa:_ A transformer-based model that considers the relationships between words in a sentence. It provides a deeper and more nuanced understanding of sentiment by learning context during pre-training.

**Outcome:**

The project demonstrated how both models can be applied to review data and compared their performance. While VADER is faster and simpler, RoBERTa provides more accurate and nuanced sentiment predictions, making it ideal for more complex datasets.
